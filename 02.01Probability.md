An introduction to the theory of probability for students in mathematics, statistics, engineering, and the sciences (including computer science, biology, the social sciences, and management science) who possess the prerequisite knowledge of elementary calculus. It attempts to present not only the mathematics of probability theory, but also, through numerous examples, the many diverse possible applications of this subject.
