# GTWA - Graph Theory With Applications ✅ 
### *by Bondy & Murty*

*Graph Theory with Applications by Bondy and Murty provides a systematic introduction to finite graph theory, combining rigorous theory with concrete, real-world applications. The book develops the structural foundations of graphs—connectivity, trees, cycles, matchings, colourings, planarity, flows, and directed graphs—while emphasizing proof techniques, extremal reasoning, and algorithmic ideas. Throughout, abstract results are consistently motivated and illustrated by classical optimization and network problems (such as shortest paths, matchings, flows, and routing), making the text both a theoretical reference and a bridge to applied graph theory.*
